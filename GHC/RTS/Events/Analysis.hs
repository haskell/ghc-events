-- | This is based on a simple finite state machine hence the names `delta`
-- for the state transition function.
-- Since states might be more than simple pattern matched constructors, we
-- use `finals :: state -> Bool`, rather than `Set state`, to indicate that
-- the machine is in some final state. Similarly for `alpha`, which
-- indicates the alphabet of inputs to a machine.
-- The function `delta` returns `Maybe` values, where `Nothing`
-- indicates that no valid transition is possible: ie, there has been an
-- error.

-- | The `step` function runs a machine in a state against a single input.

-- is started from its initial state and run against the inputs in turn.
